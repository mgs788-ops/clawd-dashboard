# Kanban (Mr Helper)

## Backlog
- [ ] Logging redaction patterns (tokens/keys) + verify via `openclaw security audit` (needs gateway restart)
- [ ] Cron monitor hardening: exec allowlist for main + re-enable cron failure alerts after restart
- [ ] Monthly property value tracking (realestate.com.au estimates) — first run + storage format
- [ ] Moltbot self-audit + community best-practice review (est: 4–6h)
- [ ] LTR capital reallocation ideas (if trimming/selling)
- [ ] Apple Podcasts: recommendations based on your shows
- [ ] Email monitoring for mrhelperbot@icloud.com (Himalaya + app-specific password) — decide A(draft) vs B(auto-send)
- [ ] Daily AI Agent Use-Case Scout (Modbot) — review outputs + decide YES/NO daily
- [ ] Spending Behaviour Deep Dive — 12 months (plan drafted; needs full 12 months data)

## In progress
- [ ] LTR investment brief (draft created; needs ASX filing verification + your cost base)

## System / Reliability
- [ ] Cron monitor (2x consecutive errors) — enable exec allowlist for main + re-enable cron after gateway restart
- [ ] Logging redaction patterns — apply + verify via `openclaw security audit` after gateway restart
- [ ] Cross-context messaging (Slack↔Telegram) — enable `tools.message.crossContext.allowAcrossProviders` + add permission/confirmation guardrails; validate via `openclaw doctor`
